#Research\
**Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics Research**\
Developed a new form of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation to describe magnetization dynamics in highly anisotropic modern magnetic nanodevices and wrote new code packages for M^3, a MATLAB-based micromagnetics software, to test possible magnetic relaxation mechanisms.

**Magnetic Nanotechnology Research**\
Designed a novel magnetic multilayer system using core-shell nanoparticles for non-invasive temperature measurement that improved signal strength for remote thermometry by 2350%.

**Bacterial Metal Reduction Research**\
Studied insoluble iron reduction rates and extracellular electron transport in bacteria from the genus Shewanella for applications in sustainable electric fuel cells.
* Supervisor: [Dr. Kenneth Nealson](https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003571), University of Southern California [May-August 2015]
**Sickle Cell Disease Research**\
Investigated vertebral, liver, and splenic iron storage in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia through MATLAB analysis of MRI studies.

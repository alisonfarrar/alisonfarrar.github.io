Hi, I'm Alison. Thanks for checking out my website. I'm a scientist and a medical student, and I'm interested in investigating questions in human biology using quantitative modeling and experimental methods from the physical sciences. I believe this kind of interdisciplinary work can lead to big breakthroughs in our understanding of basic biology, microbiology, and human pathology.

Hi, I'm Alison. Thanks for checking out my website. I'm a scientist and a medical student, and I'm interested in investigating questions in human biology using quantitative modeling and experimental methods from the physical sciences.

I'm an aspiring physician-scientist, which means I hope to have a career that mixes clinical medicine with scientific research. I have always been a cross-disciplinary thinker, and I believe there is synergy in the privilege of learning from one's patients, witnessing the current limitations in medicine, and working to advance our understanding and treatment of human disease.

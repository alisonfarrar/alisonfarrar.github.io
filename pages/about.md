Hi, I'm Alison. Thanks for checking out my website. I'm a scientist and a medical student, and I'm interested in investigating questions in human biology using quantitative modeling and experimental methods from the physical sciences.

I'm an aspiring physician-scientist, which means I hope to have a career that mixes clinical medicine with scientific research. I have always been a cross-disciplinary thinker, and I believe there is synergy in the privilege of learning from one's patients, witnessing the current limitations in medicine, and working to advance our understanding and treatment of human disease. I hope that both my clinical practice and scientific work will improve health equity and advance social justice.

Outside of medicine and science, I am a total bookworm (check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38821028-alison) to see what I've been reading!), I love swimming and running, and I play classical piano and the pipe organ.
